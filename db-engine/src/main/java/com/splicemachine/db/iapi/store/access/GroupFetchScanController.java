/**
  This scan controller can only be used for group fetch, no update
  operations are supported, use ScanController if you need scan interfaces
  other than group fetch.
  <p>
  In general group fetch will be more efficient than using the 
  ScanController fetchNext() interface to get rows one at a time.  The
  performance comes from reducing the per call overhead of getting
  a row.  Also this interface can, depending on the requested isolation
  level, possibly do more efficient locking.
  <p>
  Group fetch scans are opened from a TransactionController.

     * Fetch the next N rows from the table.
     * <p>
     * The client allocates an array of N rows and passes it into the
     * fetchNextSet() call.  The client must at least allocate a row and
     * set row_array[0] to this row.  The client can optionally either leave
     * the rest of array entries null, or allocate rows to the slots.
     * If access finds an entry to be null, and wants to read a row into
     * it, it will allocate a row to the slot.  Once fetchNextGroup() returns
     * "ownership" of the row passes back to the client, access will not 
     * keep references to the allocated row.  Expected usage is that 
     * the client will specify an array of some number (say 10), and then 
     * only allocate a single row.  This way if only 1 row qualifies only
     * one row will have been allocated.
     * <p>
     * This routine does the equivalent of N 
     * fetchNext() calls, filling in each of the rows in the array.
     * Locking is performed exactly as if the N fetchNext() calls had
     * been made.
     * <p>
     * It is up to Access how many rows to return.  fetchNextGroup() will
     * return how many rows were filled in.  If fetchNextGroup() returns 0
     * then the scan is complete, (ie. the scan is in the same state as if
     * fetchNext() had returned false).  If the scan is not complete then
     * fetchNext() will return (1 <= row_count <= N).
     * <p>
     * The current position of the scan is undefined if fetchNextSet()
     * is used (ie. mixing fetch()/fetchNext() and fetchNextSet() calls
     * in a single scan does not work).  This is because a fetchNextSet()
     * request for 5 rows from a heap where the first 2 rows qualify, but
     * no other rows qualify will result in the scan being positioned at
     * the end of the table, while if 5 rows did qualify the scan will be
     * positioned on the 5th row.
     * <p>
     * If the row loc array is non-null then for each row fetched into
     * the row array, a corresponding fetchLocation() call will be made to
     * fill in the rowloc_array.  This array, like the row array can be 
     * initialized with only one non-null RowLocation and access will 
     * allocate the rest on demand.
     * <p>
     * Qualifiers, start and stop positioning of the openscan are applied
     * just as in a normal scan. 
     * <p>
     * The columns of the row will be the standard columns returned as
     * part of a scan, as described by the validColumns - see openScan for
     * description.
     * <p>
     * Expected usage:
     *
     * // allocate an array of 5 empty rows
     * DataValueDescriptor[][] row_array = allocate_row_array(5);
     * int row_cnt = 0;
     *
     * scan = openScan();
     *
     * while ((row_cnt = scan.fetchNextSet(row_array, null) != 0)
     * {
     *     // I got "row_cnt" rows from the scan.  These rows will be
     *     // found in row_array[0] through row_array[row_cnt - 1]
     * }
     *
     * <p>
	 * @return The number of qualifying rows found and copied into the 
     *         provided array of rows.  If 0 then the scan is complete, 
     *         otherwise the return value will be: 
     *         1 <= row_count <= row_array.length
     *
     * @param row_array         The array of rows to copy rows into.  
     *                          row_array[].length must >= 1.   The first entry

     *                          may be null and will be allocated by access
     *                          if needed.
